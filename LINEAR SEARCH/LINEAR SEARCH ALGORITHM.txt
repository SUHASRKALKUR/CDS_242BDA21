									LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM

Step 1: START
Step 2: Get input from user for number of students they want to enter
Step 3: Create an empty list called students
Step 4: Using for loop, loop through all the names of the students entered by the user which can be used to enter the given names into the empty list called students
		For i in range(i, countofnames+1):
			y = input()
students .append(y)
		END of for loop
Step 5 : Get input from the user for the Name they want to search from the given list
Step 6: define a function called linear operation then using for loop iterate through each and every elements in the list. 
Using IF statement check whether the entered name by the user is there in the list
		def linearoperation(names, students):
			for student in range (len(students))
				if(name==students[student])
					print(“Student studies in the class”)
				END of IF Statement
			END of FOR Loop
Step 7: END
